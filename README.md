# Real-Time Collab Shopping and Split the Bill by BuddyShopping

_BuddyShopping_ is an Ecwid app that helps customers shop together in real time.

Say, you're planning a party. You like pizza, Alice likes Chinese, and Ali is all about shawarma. There's an online shop that has all the required foods and offers delivery, but since you're not in the same room, you can't just sit together and pick the food. Also, there's a hundred varieties of pizza, Chinese food, and shawarmas, so just playing with the options and making the order for three will take a lot of time.

What do you do? How do you let three people order their own stuff and have it all in the same shopping cart, split by person, so that you could split the bill afterward?

Luckily, there's _BuddyShopping_ app for Ecwid. If it's installed, any customer can share their shopping session with friends, letting them contribute to a shared shopping cart and helping the host split the bill.

Back to the party, here's what you do:

1.  Click “Shop with friends” button:

2.  Click “Copy invitation link”:

3.  Send it to your friends:

4.  Shop! Add items to cart like you normally do and see others do the same:

5.  When your friend is finished with their order, they click “Ready to checkout.” When all your friends have done so, click “Proceed to checkout”:

6.  Pay for the order as usual. If you want to split the bill, click “Split the bill” button and download the order slip:
